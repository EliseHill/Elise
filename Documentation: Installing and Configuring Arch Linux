Documentation: Installing and Configuring Arch Linux
1. Creating the Virtual Machine
   1. Set Up VirtualBox:
    - Download and install VirtualBox.
    - Create a new virtual machine named Arch Linux.
    - Allocate 2GB RAM and 20GB storage (later resized due to insufficient space issues).
    - Use a dynamically allocated VDI file for the virtual hard disk.
   Attach Arch Linux ISO:
    - Download the Arch Linux ISO from the official website.
    - Attach the ISO file to the virtual machine under Settings â†’ Storage.
2. Booting Into the Arch ISO
  1. Start the Virtual Machine:
    - Boot the VM with the attached Arch ISO.
  2. Load the Live Environment:
    - After booting, you are presented with a shell prompt in the Arch live environment.
3. Partitioning the Disk
    1. Launch cfdisk: "cfdisk /dev/sda" 
    2. Create Partitions:
      - Created a root partition (/dev/sda1).
      - Initially created a swap partition (/dev/sda2), which was later removed to expand the root partition due to insufficient space issues.
Error Encountered:
  - Insufficient Disk Space: 
    While installing the base system, received the error: "error: Partition / too full: 143755 blocks needed 63299 blocks free"
Solution: 
  - Booted into the ISO again and deleted the swap partition to free space
  - Resized the root partition to utilize the full disk space

4. Formatting and Mounting Partitions
  1. Format Partitions: 
      - For the root partitions: "mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1"
      - For the swap partition (before it was removed): "mkswap /dev/sda2 and swapon /dev/sda2"
  2. Mount the Root Partition: "mount /dev/sda1 /mnt"

5. Installing the Base System:
  1. Install Base Packages: "pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware"
  2. Generate fstab: "genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab"
  3. Chroot into the System: "arch-chroot /mnt"

6. Configuring the System
  1. Set Locale:
    - Editied "/etc/locale.gen" to uncomment "en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8" : "nano /etc/locale.gen"
    - Generated locales: "locale-gen"
    - Set system language: "echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf"
  2. Set Hostsname: "echo "archvm" > /etc/hostname"
  3. Set Root Password: "passwd"
7. Installing and Configuring GRUB
  1. Install GRUB: "pacman -S grub
grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg"
  ERROR ENCOUNTERED:
    - BIOS Boot Partition Missing:
      initially encountered: "grub-install: warning: this GPT partition label contains no BIOS Boot Partition.
grub-install: error: will not proceed with blocklists."
  SOLUTION:
    - Created a 2MB BIOS boot partition (type EFO2 using cfdisk)
8. Rebooting into the installed system
  1. Exit and Unmount: "exit
                        umount -R /mnt
                        reboot"
  2. Boot into the installed Arch Linux system. 

9. Encountering Errors after Reboot
  Upon rebooting: 
    - Soft Lockup and CPU Errors: 
      Logs indicated high CPU utilization and system stalls: "watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 30s!
                                                              rcu_preempt detected stalls on CPUs/tasks.
                                                              Failed to start Network Time Synchronization."
  Possible Causes: 
    - Insuffcient resources allocated to the VM. 
    - Kernel misconfiguration or compatability issues. 

10. Reccomendations for Fixing Errors
  1. Verify Virtual Machine Resources:
      - Increase allocated CPU cores (minimum 2 cores).
      - Increase memory (recommend 4GB).
  2. Check Kernel Logs:
      - Boot into the Arch ISO and investigate logs: "journalctl -b"
  3. Update System: 
    - Ensure the latest kernel and firmware updates are installed: "pacman -Syu"
  4. Use a Lighter Kernel:
    - If the default kernel causes issues, consider switching to the LTS kernel: "pacman -S linux-lts"
SUMARRY
  Despite encountering several errors during installation, progress was made through:
  - Adjusting partition sizes
  - Reinstalling GRUB with a BIOS boot partition. 
  - Investing system logs for potential kernel-related issues
